# Ceylon Codegolf Solutions

This repository collects my solutions to problems from the
[Programming Puzzles and Code Golf][1] Stack Exchange site (in short PPCG),
written in [Ceylon][2].

(Of course, because Ceylon is a quite verbose language, those
 will about never be the shortest possible solutions to any given
 problem. But I hope they'll still be interesting ones.)

All the programs here work with Ceylon 1.2 (even when they were originally
developed with Ceylon 1.1).

When the task is to create a runnable program, I opted to create a module with
a `shared void run()` function – those will be called when using

    ceylon run ‹module name›

The programs here are formatted and indented in order to be legible – to get
the shorter version posted at PPCG, remove all superfluous spaces and comments.
